Summary for Project

Data Analysis:                                                                                         
1.) Comparison of Temperatures to Latitudes shows season change (transition to Spring or Fall).                                            
2.) Humidity in the northern hemipshere appears to be more prominent and may indicate change of seasons - again potentially moisture from Spring weather.                      
3.) The most desirable vacation locations appear to be either in arrid regions or coastal (oceanic) areas both and south of the equator.                                      
4.) Regarding cloudiness, it would be interesting to break down by population to remove any influences from human factors.

Summary for Project

Data Analysis:                                                                                         
1.) Comparison of Temperatures to Latitudes can inidicate time of year (transition to Spring or Fall).                                            
2.) Humidity in the northern hemipshere appears to be more prominent and may indicate change of seasons - again potentially moisture from Spring weather.                      
3.) The most desirable vacation locations appear to be either in arrid regions or coastal (oceanic) areas both north and south of the equator.                              
4.) Regarding cloudiness, it would be interesting to filter and compare by population to remove influences from any human factors.

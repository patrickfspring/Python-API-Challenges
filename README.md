Weather Influences on Vacation Destinations using Python APIs

Summary for Project - Tasks:
1.) Created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following for 500+ cities:
    (a.) Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    (b.) Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    (c.) Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    (d.) Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
2.) Completed linear regressions on each relationship above, separating the relationships by Northern/Southern Hemispheres.
3.) Created a heat map that displays the humdity for every city, using jupyter-gmaps and Google Places API.
4.) Filtered the cities down to idealy weather conditions using DataFrame.
5.) Located the first hotel for each city located with 5000 meeters of coordinates being used.Using Google Places API,
   
Conclusion for Project - Data Analysis:                                                                                         
1.) Comparison plots of Temperatures to Latitudes can indicate time of year (transition to Spring or Fall).                                            
2.) Humidity in the northern hemipshere appears to be more prominent and may indicate change of seasons - again potentially moisture from Spring weather.                      
3.) The most desirable vacation locations appear to be either in arrid regions or coastal (oceanic) areas both north and south of the equator.  Seasonal oceanic weather, may be making these the best spots.                             
4.) Regarding cloudiness, it would be interesting to filter and compare by population to remove human influences.
